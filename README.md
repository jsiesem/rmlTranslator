# rmlTranslator
This transfers .nc code into the Roland CNC specific .rml format

At the time this is specifically used for a Roland Modula Pro 2 MDX 540.
Planned next steps:
  PyQt UI wrapper
    Interactive file selection
    nc offset correction
    variable control and confirmation
  Safety checks
    Additional spindle speed control
    Collision control (boundary and height)
  NC processing
    code division for tool changes
    boundary verification
  
  
  

The project is developed for student use of the workshop facilities at the Aarhus School of Architecture.
