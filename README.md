Tool to transfer .nc code into the Roland CNC specific .rml format
Currently, this is specifically used for a Roland Modula Pro 2 MDX 540.

## Planned next steps:
  ### PyQt UI wrapper
    - Interactive file selection
    - NC offset correction
    - Variable control and confirmation
  ### Safety checks
    - Additional spindle speed control
    - Collision control (boundary and height)
  ### NC processing
    - Code division for tool changes
    - Boundary verification
  
  
  

The project is developed for student use of the workshop facilities at the Aarhus School of Architecture.
